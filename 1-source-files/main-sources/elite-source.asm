;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This table contains ready-made pixel bytes for drawing a white two-pixel or
; three-pixel dash in the high-resolution screen mode on the Apple II.
;
; The first half of the table contains two-pixel dashes, with the entry at
; TWOS3+X containing a two-pixel dash starting at pixel X within the first pixel
; byte.
;
; The second half of the table contains three-pixel dashes, with the entry at
; TWOS3+14+X containing a three-pixel dash starting at pixel X within the first
; pixel byte.
;
; Bit 7 in each byte is used to define the colour palette in that byte, so the
; pixels themselves are defined in bits 0 to 6. The pixels in bits 0 to 6 appear
; in that order on-screen, so bit 0 is on the left. The comments below show how
; the two bytes map into the screen, with seven pixels per byte.

;    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
;  Deep dive: Stardust in the front view
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
; view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
; signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
; batch of calculations.
;
; When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
; the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
; along one of the four edges of the screen.
;
; These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
;
;   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
;   2. z = z - speed * 64
;   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
;   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
;
;   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
;   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
;
;   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
;   8. y = y - beta * 256
;
; For more information see the associated deep dive.

;       Name: MAS1
;       Type: Subroutine
;   Category: Maths (Geometry)
;    Summary: Add an orientation vector coordinate to an INWK coordinate
;  Deep dive: The space station safe zone
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
; an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
; coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
; arguments X and Y.
;
; In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
; following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:
;
;   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
;
; as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
; the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Arguments:
;
;   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
;
;                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
;                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
;                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
;
;   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
;
;                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
;                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)
;                         * If Y = 13, add (nosev_z_hi nosev_z_lo)
;

;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Given a value in Y that points to the start of a ship data block as an offset
; from K%, calculate the following:
;
;   A = A OR x_sign OR y_sign OR z_sign
;
; and clear the sign bit of the result. The K% workspace contains the ship data
; blocks, so the offset in Y must be 0 or a multiple of NI% (as each block in
; K% contains NI% bytes).
;
; The result effectively contains a maximum cap of the three values (though it
; might not be one of the three input values - it's just guaranteed to be
; larger than all of them).
;
; If Y = 0 and A = 0, then this calculates the maximum cap of the highest byte
; containing the distance to the planet, as K%+2 = x_sign, K%+5 = y_sign and
; K%+8 = z_sign (the first slot in the K% workspace represents the planet).

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),

;
; The maximum number of digits that we can print with the BPRNT routine is 11,

;
; This section sets up some vectors and calculates dot products. Specifically:
;
;   * If this is a lone Thargon without a mothership, set it adrift aimlessly
;     and we're done
;
;   * If this is a trader, 80% of the time we're done, 20% of the time the

;
;   * If this is a bounty hunter (or one of the 20% of traders) and we have been
;     really bad (i.e. a fugitive or serious offender), the ship becomes hostile
;     (if it isn't already)
;
;   * If the ship is not hostile, then either perform docking manoeuvres (if
;     it's docking) or fly towards the planet (if it isn't docking) and we're
;     done
;
;   * If the ship is hostile, and a pirate, and we are within the space station
;     safe zone, stop the pirate from attacking by removing all its aggression
;
;   * Calculate the dot product of the ship's nose vector (i.e. the direction it
;     is pointing) with the vector between us and the ship. This value will help
;     us work out later on whether the enemy ship is pointing towards us, and
;     therefore whether it can hit us with its lasers.

;
; Calculate the dot product of the vector in XX15 and one of the space station's

;    Summary: Calculate the vector from the ideal docking position to the ship
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This routine is called by the docking computer routine in DOCKIT. It works out
; the vector between the ship and the ideal docking position, which is straight
; in front of the docking slot, but some distance away.
;
; Specifically, it calculates the following:
;
;   * K3(2 1 0) = K3(2 1 0) - nosev_x_hi * 4
;
;   * K3(5 4 3) = K3(5 4 3) - nosev_y_hi * 4
;
;   * K3(8 7 6) = K3(8 7 6) - nosev_x_hi * 4
;
; where K3 is the vector from the station to the ship, and nosev is the nose
; vector for the space station.
;
; The nose vector points from the centre of the station through the slot, so
; -nosev * 4 is the vector from a point in front of the docking slot, but some
; way from the station, back to the centre of the station. Adding this to the
; vector from the station to the ship gives the vector from the point in front
; of the station to the ship.
;
; In practice, this routine is called twice, so the ideal docking position is
; actually at a distance of 8 unit vectors from the centre of the station.
;
; Back in DOCKIT, we flip this vector round to get the vector from the ship to
; the point in front of the station slot.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Arguments:
;
;   K3                  The vector from the station to the ship

;   K3                  The vector from the ship to the ideal docking position

;   P = DELTA / (the Y-th stardust particle's z_hi coordinate)
;
;   R = remainder as a fraction of A, where 1.0 = 255

;   (P R) = 256 * DELTA / z_hi
;
; DELTA is a value between 1 and 40, and the minimum z_hi is 16 (dust particles
; are removed at lower values than this), so this means P is between 0 and 2
; (as 40 / 16 = 2.5, so the maximum result is P = 2 and R = 128.

;    Summary: Add a new ship to our local bubble of universe
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
; block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
; empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there
; isn't enough free memory for the new ship, it isn't added.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Arguments:
;
;   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
;                       list of ship types)
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Returns:
;
;   C flag              Set if the ship was successfully added, clear if it
;                       wasn't (as there wasn't enough free memory)
;
;   INF                 Points to the new ship's data block in K%

;  Deep dive: Extended screen coordinates
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Project the current ship's location or the planet onto the screen, either
; returning the screen coordinates of the projection (if it's on-screen), or
; returning an error via the C flag.
;
; In this context, "on-screen" means that the point is projected into the

;
;   centre of screen - 1024 < x < centre of screen + 1024
;   centre of screen - 1024 < y < centre of screen + 1024
;
; This is to cater for ships (and, more likely, planets and suns) whose centres
; are off-screen but whose edges may still be visible.

;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
; and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
;
; A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
; routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
; new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
; when applying AI tactics to ships.
;
; We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
; K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
; we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
; to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.

;    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
; game's configuration.
;
; Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
; following keys:
;
;   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (0)
;   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (1)
;   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (2)
;   * F toggles flashing console bars (3)
;   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (4)
;   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (5)
;   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (6)
;
; The numbers in brackets are the configuration options that we pass in Y. We
; pass the ASCII code of the key that has been pressed in X, and the option to
; check it against in Y, so this routine is typically called in a loop that
; loops through the various configuration option.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Arguments:
;
;   X                   The ASCII code of the key that's been pressed

;   Y                   The number of the configuration option to check against

;  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
;             Orientation vectors
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
; making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
; and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
;
; We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
; vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
; to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
; routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

;  Deep dive: Multiplication and division using logarithms
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Calculate the following, where A < Q:
;
;   R = 256 * A / Q
;
; This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
;
; If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
; (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
;
; The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
; by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
;
; This routine uses the same logarithm algorithm that's documented in FMLTU,
; except it subtracts the logarithm values, to do a division instead of a
; multiplication.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Returns:
;
;   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
;                       division was a success

;

;   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag

; This section projects the coordinate of the vertex into screen coordinates and

;

;
; Note that U is always zero when we get to this point, as the vertex is always
; in front of us (so it has a positive z-coordinate, into the screen).

;       Type: Subroutine
;   Category: Drawing lines
;    Summary: Draw a ship line using flicker-free animation
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This routine implements flicker-free ship animation by erasing and redrawing
; each individual line in the ship, rather than the approach in the other
; Acornsoft versions of the game, which erase the entire existing ship before
; drawing the new one.
;
; Here's the new approach in this routine:
;
;   * Draw the new line
;
;   * Fetch the corresponding existing line (in position LSNUM) from the heap
;
;   * Store the new line in the heap at this position, replacing the old one
;
;   * If the existing line we just took from the heap is on-screen, erase it
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Arguments:
;
;   LSNUM               The offset within the line heap where we add the new
;                       line's coordinates
;
;   X1                  The screen x-coordinate of the start of the line to add
;                       to the ship line heap
;
;   Y1                  The screen y-coordinate of the start of the line to add
;                       to the ship line heap
;
;   X2                  The screen x-coordinate of the end of the line to add
;                       to the ship line heap
;
;   Y2                  The screen y-coordinate of the end of the line to add
;                       to the ship line heap
;

;    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
; Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
; by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
; following:
;
;   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
;
; (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
; it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
; routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
; 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
; sign of the delta.)
;
; The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
; is determined by the value of X.
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Arguments:
;
;   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
;
;   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
;
;                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
;
;                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
;
;                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; The character rows in screen memory for the Apple II high-res screen are not
; stored in the order in which they appear. The SCTBL, SCTBH and SCTBH2 tables
; provide a lookup for the address of the start of each character row.
;
; Also, the pixel rows within each character row are interleaved, so each pixel
; row appears $400 bytes after the previous pixel row. The address of pixel row
; n within character row Y is stored at the address given in the Y-th entry of
; (SCTBH SCTBL), plus n * $400, so the addresses are as follows:
;
;   * Pixel row 0 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL)
;   * Pixel row 1 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $400
;   * Pixel row 2 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $800
;   * Pixel row 3 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $C00
;   * Pixel row 4 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $1000
;   * Pixel row 5 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $1400
;   * Pixel row 6 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $1800
;   * Pixel row 7 is at the Y-th entry from (SCTBH SCTBL) + $1C00
;
; To make life easier, the table at SCTBH2 contains the high byte for the final
; row, where the high byte has $1C00 added to the address.

;    Summary: High-resolution pixel bytes for drawing continuous lines of solid
;             colour
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This table contains four bytes for each colour (the colour variables such as
; VIOLET and RED are indexes into this table).
;
; The first three bytes contain the values we need to store in screen memory to
; draw a continuous line in the relevant colour; the fourth byte is ignored and
; is zero. Bytes #0 and #1 contain the bit pattern for when the first byte is
; placed in an even-numbered pixel byte (counting along the pixel row), while
; bytes #1 and #2 contain the bit pattern for when the first byte is placed in
; an odd-numbered pixel byte.
;
; The comments show the on-off patterns that the high-resolution mode converts
; into colours, with bit 7 removed for clarity.
